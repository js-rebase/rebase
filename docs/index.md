features:
  - title: Explicit by design
    details: A Rebase instance only processes syntax that has been registered. Unknown syntax stays untouched.
  - title: Built to extend
    details: Directives, blocks, expressions and hooks let plugins add focused capabilities without changing the core.
  - title: Works with your stack
    details: Rebase is an enhancement layer, not a replacement for Svelte, Vue, React or plain HTML.
  - title: Small runtime
    details: The core focuses on syntax registration, transformation, mounting and a predictable plugin API.

## A small extension layer

A date formatter, icon system or project-specific directive does not need to become a framework.

Register it with Rebase and keep it as an independent plugin:

```js
const rebase = createRebase();

rebase.use(date);

await rebase.transform("{@date as DD.MM.YYYY}");
```
